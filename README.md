# Hero Database

This project has been deployed: https://shaqs-superhero-database.surge.sh/

## Project

For fun, I developed a page where users can search for a superhero or villain of their choice, and find out some details about them.

For this project, I accessed the the Superhero API: https://superheroapi.com/

#### Notice

The Superhero API is currently down, and so this project doesn't work as intended. I'll be looking at adjusting to a similar API soon.

## Future adjustments

In future, I will be improving the css styling, as well as ensuring users can search by real name, place of birth and age also.
